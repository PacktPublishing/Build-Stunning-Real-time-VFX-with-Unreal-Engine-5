This book is for visual effects artists transitioning to real-time virtual production workflow as well as beginners looking to learn Niagara for games and other real-time applications. Game programmers, 3D generalists, and game designers interested in adding VFX for their game and metaverse projects will also find this book useful. A basic understanding of Unreal Engine 5, blueprints, as well as layout, materials, and lighting in Unreal Engine is expected.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-15).

### Software and Hardware List

Before diving into Unreal Engine’s Niagara, it’s recommended that you have a basic understanding of
the Unreal Engine editor. Additionally, familiarity with visual scripting languages such as Blueprint
or similar programming languages will be helpful but is not required.
It’s also beneficial to have a general understanding of computer graphics and the concepts behind
particle systems, such as emitters, particle lifetimes, and particle attributes. Familiarity with vector
math and basic physics concepts can also be useful when working with particle simulations. Some of
these basics are covered in the initial chapters.
